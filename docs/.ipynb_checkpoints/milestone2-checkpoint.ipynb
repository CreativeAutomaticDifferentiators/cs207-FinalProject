    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to provide a working library for automatic differentiation. Automatic differentiation is a method for numerically calculating the derivative of a function. Derivative calculations are essential in many modern numerical algorithms, and automatic differentiation is one method that can quickly compute derivatives by executing elementary functions via the chain rule. \n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to other differentiation methods (such as symbolic/analytic differentiation or numerical differentiation), automatic differentiation boasts more efficient calculations and high accuracy to working precision. Symbolic differentiation requires mathematical expressions of derivatives to be kept throughout the process, which can lead to inefficient code. Numerical differentation is heavily reliant on an optimal value of `h`, and too small or big values of `h` can lead to large floating point errors or inaccuracy, respectively. Therefore, automatic differentic differentiation provides efficiency and accuracy advantages (in most cases)."

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, automatic differentiation is centered upon the ability to use the chain rule to decompose derivatives of complex functions to derivatives of elementary functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of automatic differentiation is to decompose a function into elementary function. To do so, we use a chain of function composition. The forward mode enables to compute values of the function. We can compute the derivatives using the reverse mode or using dual numbers. Dual numbers are basically numbers that are real, the dual number squared is equal to zero. We can single out the derivative of a function by composing the Taylor series of elementary functions. \n"

We will distribute our package on Pypi, it is also a setup tool that will package our software. Hence users can use the pip install command."

    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the basic data structures on python. We will implement a dual number class, and a function class. The function class will have attributes to evaluate the values of the function and of its derivatives. The dual class will have two attributes for the real and the imaginary part.\n",

    "We will rely on numpy for some evaluations, notably for the elementary functions. To handle their derivatives, we will use two methods. The first one is with the dual numbers and we will use the well-known taylor series of this elementary functions. The second method is to use their symbolic derivatives which are also well known.\n"
